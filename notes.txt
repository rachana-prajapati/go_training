Golang
    Why Golang?
        - Simplicity
        - Easy to build concurrent applications
        - Fast

    Simplicity
        - No classes
        - No inheritance (only composition)
        - No Exceptions (only errors)
        - No access modifiers (public, private, protected)

        ONLY 25 keywords

    Built for concurrency
        - Builtin Scheduler
        - goroutines
        - OS thread (2 MB), Goroutine (4 KB)
        - Language features for concurrency
            go, chan, select, range

    Strongly Typed
    Compiled
    Performance is comparable to C
    Garbage Collector
    No Runtime (JVM, CLR)
    Support for pointers
    Everything is 'by value' by default (References are handled using pointers)
